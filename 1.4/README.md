# Lists

## calculate student's average 
 The program initializes an empty list for grades, prompts the user for input in a loop, and adds valid float inputs to the list. It exits the loop if "exit" is typed. Afterward, it calculates and prints the average GPA if grades were entered; otherwise, it notifies that no grades were entered.
 *****
 ## generate an Array with Unique Random Numbers 
 The program prompts the user for a positive integer n (up to 100) and uses random.sample() to generate 
n unique random integers from the range [0, 100). It then prints the generated array. The range can be adjusted as long as it has at least 
n unique values.
*****
## Check if an Array is Sorted
The is_sorted function uses Python's all() to check if each element in the list is less than or equal to the next. The program takes the array length and each element as input, then prints whether the array is sorted in ascending order. It handles any integer list input correctly.
*****
## Draw a Striped Snake Pattern

The draw_snake_pattern function creates a pattern of * and # symbols by appending based on even or odd indices from 0 to 𝑛-1.The program ensuresn is positive and uses a try-except block for input validation, outputting the correct alternating pattern for any positive integer input.
*****
## Reverse a List
This code will handle any list of integers provided by the user, displaying the list in reverse order without using the reverse() method.
*****
## Remove Duplicates from a List
The remove_duplicates function adds each list element to unique_lst only if it hasn’t been encountered before, using a set to track seen elements. The program reads space-separated integers, handles invalid input with an error message, and prints both the original and deduplicated lists, preserving the original order.

You can run the program
```
python.py
```
