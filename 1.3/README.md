# Student's average 
  In this code, we  get "n" scores from the user and with for loop and after that Python calculate average of "n" scores.

# Countdown Timer
  To write this code, in first place, we import time and then ask the user for input seconds.
  finally we use while loop to countdown steps.

# Rolling Dice
  In this code by importing random we use random.randint() and the program generate random number between (1 and 6).

# Stars 
  In these practices we should use for loop to have outputs like, square, triangle and diomaond in order to print star patterns.

  To run this program:
  Python.py
