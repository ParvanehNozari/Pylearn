## Generate a QR code 
To run this code, you'll need to install the qrcode package, which is a Python library for generating QR codes.
To install the qrcode package, you can use pip, which is the package manager for Python.
The program prompts the user to enter their name and phone number, then combines this information into a single string. It generates a QR code from the combined text using the qrcode library and saves it as an image file named "my_qr_code.png".

## Check if a number is Factorial 
The program takes an integer input from the user and checks if it is a factorial of any integer. It uses a while loop to multiply sequential integers until the factorial value matches or exceeds the input. If the factorial matches the input, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".
